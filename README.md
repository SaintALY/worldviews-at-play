## About the Game 🎮

In this unique game, players are guided by a generative AI that leads them through various stages, adjusting questions and topics in real-time. The game is divided into different parts, and so far, we have developed a prototype for the first part: the quiz.

### The Quiz 📝

Before entering the game, each player must answer a set of 10 questions. These questions are designed to understand the player's perspective on various world issues. Based on the answers, an AI creates a profile for the player, influencing the game's dynamics.

The quiz is beautifully designed by **Lioba Rubik** and skillfully developed by **Amadeus Hoffmann**.

#### Try the Prototype!

You can try the working prototype of the quiz [here](https://worldview-quiz-seven.vercel.app/).
